- This section will go over how to search for records based on your criteria utilizing filters on the fields of the records

### Fiter based on Name of Record
![Record Table Search Bar](../../../../../assets/metadata-tool/metadata-tool-09.png)

- In the table searchbar, you can enter a word or partial word. The filter will display all record names that contain the exact word or partial word you entered, anywhere within the name of the record. 
- Ex. you type 'sales' it will show all datasets with names like 'sales_data,' and 'monthly_sales'. However, from the two example names,if you type 'data', only 'sales_data' will be displayed on the table.
